# minefield-game
Minefield game using python interpreter/terminal. The player has 6 lives to move from the bottom of the board to the top without landing on one of the randomly generated mines. Once a mine has been landed on the player loses a life and goes back to the bottom of the board; the position of the mine is marked with an X. If the player reaches the top of the board they win, but if they run out of lives it's game over.
